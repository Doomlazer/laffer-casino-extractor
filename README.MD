The game is not easily playable on modern systems without the use of a virtual machine and *requires* that it be ran in 16-bit "high-color" mode. While I don't believe the sprite file-format has been reverse engineered prior; this repository might be a first.

This version of Larry's Casino should not be be confused with the older SCI-based mini-game: Crazy Nick's Software Picks: Leisure Suit Larry Casino which was a small single-disk game released by Sierra for $9.95 via mail-order.

This game was not a traditional SCI-based game and instead was built entirely on Windows 98 making use of DirectX, and GDI for rendering to the screen. It also had an online component that connected to Sierra's W.O.N. multi-player system which stands for World Opponent Network which is now defunct. W.O.N. was quite innovative for its time and helped fascilitate the push for online gaming as we know it today. Other efforts by Sierra also might be memorable: T.S.N - The Sierra Network and The Realm.
